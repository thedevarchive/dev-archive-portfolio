### `npm install`

# How to Use

Use the links in the navigation bar at the top of the portfolio page to navigate through the website. 

To download my resume, click on Download Resume on the Home page. 

In the Projects page, you can also click the buttons on the project cards to access their repositories or their websites. 

In the Contacts page, you can copy my email address by clicking on the Copy button at the right-hand side. 

__NOTE:__ Projects with private repositories have a Request GitHub Access button instead of a direct link to the repository. Clicking on those buttons will redirect you to my Contacts page, where you can contact me for access to those repositories. I did this as some projects were created while finishing my university studies, and due to their plagiarism policies, I am restricting access to the repos for a certain period of time. Thus, when you contact me for access, I will ask you a few questions for verification purposes, and if you meet the standards, only then will I provide you access to the private repo in question.
